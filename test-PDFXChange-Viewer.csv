1|A Taxonomic Framework for Social Machines
1|So-cial machines are typically presented as systems that combine some form of socialparticipation with conventional forms of machine-based ‘computation’.
1|little consensus as to what the term‘social machine’ actually means
1|little has been done to explore thecore features of social machines and examine differences between them
1|limits our ability to imagine the kinds of social machine that could emerge in thefuture

3|in the absenceof an ability to say what social machines are it becomes difﬁcult to know whereto focus research and engineering efforts.
3|lack of a deﬁnition also complicatesthe effort to distinguish social machines from ostensibly similar systems

5|Smart and Shadbolt [46] have proposed the following working deﬁnitionof a social machine:
5|Social machines are Web-based socio-technical systems in which the human and techno-logical elements play the role of participant machinery with respect to the mechanistic re-alization of system-level processes.
5|Social Machines - working deﬁnition
5|humansand machines are deemed to be jointly involved in the physical realization of pro-cesses
5|constitute part of the social machinery by which suchprocesses are physically realized
5|participant machinery
5|extra-organismic resources as (on occasion)participating in the material realization of human mental states and processes
5|A social machine is thussimilar to what has been dubbed a ‘Web-extended mind’
5|Web-extended mind
5|social machine is an extendedfunctional organization in which the explanation of certain system-level processesrequires an account that adverts to the details of mechanisms that are distributedacross both the biological (human) and the technological (conventional computing

6|features of social machine systems
6|social machines aresocio-technical systems
6|they involve the participation of human individualsand technological components
6|complement one another with respect to the process that is being realized
6|advanced problem-solving capabilities
6|able to extend the reach of both human and machine intelligence
6|social ma-chines are cast as Web-based systems
6|Although we do not rule out the possibilityof social machines that are independent of the Web,12we suggest that the properties
6|Clocks may provide one example of a social machine that is independent of the Web.
6|Theclock, in this case, can be seen as the technological element of a social machine in the sense thatit is inﬂuencing social interaction via the delivery of machine-generated temporal representations.
7|of the Web make Web-based social machines a particularly important focus of so-cial and scientiﬁc attention.
7|enablesus to tap into the capabilities of human agents in a manner (and on a scale) thathas never been seen before
7|social machines are systems that consist of multiple (human) individu-als
7|accomplish tasks that require signiﬁcant amounts of effort
7|processes are central to our un-derstanding of what makes something a social machine
7|Wisdom of Crowds phenomenon
7|process that demands a (mechanistically-oriented) explanatoryaccount formulated in terms of the joint contributions of multiple individuals andWeb-based technological components
7|we are not sayingthat social machines are processes
7|social machines are the physical systems that perform, implement or realize suchprocesses
7|“any task that requires the co-constitutional involvement ofhumans and technologies is a form of social machine”
7|it is a mistake to progress from this to the conclusion thatthe task itself is a form of social machine
7|One issue concerns the temporal nature of processes
8|implication this has for the lifetime of a social machine
8|social machines have a fair amount of variabilitywith respect to their longevity
8|Temporality plays a crucial role for several other properties of social machines
8|the types of contributions madeby human participants may change depending on their role in the system
8|range of activities that are performed automatically might be expanded by the avail-ability of new algorithms
8|temporal variability
8|potential hazard of a sam-pling bias as part of our monitoring efforts
8|If our future scientiﬁc understanding of social machines isgrounded on a limited subset of social machine exemplars (i.e., the long-lived ones),then it is unclear whether our understanding will ever be complete:
8|nature and visibility of the goal that is being realized by the process.
8|Insome cases, the goal of the process that is being realized by the social machinewill not be visible to the human participants in the system
8|a social machine may be created or emerge froma technological system that was originally designed or conﬁgured to perform a dif-ferent function.
8|social machine that emerges in the context of a large-scale socialnetworking service, for example
8|varying degree of goal transparency/awareness
8|An important category of socialmachines are thus systems referred to as ‘games with a purpose’
8|‘games with a purpose’ (or GWAP)
9|players are not necessarily aware of the actual goal of the game
9|their social interactions and game play re-sult in useful training data that assists with the development of automated processes
9|ambivalent nature of such goals; one could dis-tinguish among (sometimes overlapping) component-level and system-level goals,
9|‘social processes’

9|inﬂuencing of individualthoughts and actions
9|formation, maintenance, and dissolution ofsocial relationships
9|collaborative creation of socially-sharedassets
9|social distribution of problem-solving processes
9|the role of the machine or technological elementswith respect to these processes is to constrain, control, coordinate or otherwise in-ﬂuence the social interactions between people (e.g., LinkedIn),13or, alternatively,to govern the way in which individual human contributions are collectively factoredinto some other process (e.g., reCAPTCHA14).

10|it is very common for people to refer to speciﬁctechnologies when they talk about social machines
10|It is important to be clear that when we talk aboutsocial machines we are talking about a socio-technical system (as opposed to apurely technological system) that is actively engaged in the realization of a par-ticular process
10|it is the social networking platform (that we typically identify as
10|Facebook
11|Facebook) plus the human participants (the social environment) that constitutes thesocial machine
11|Any reference to a social machine as being constituted solely by thetechnological system (or subsystem) is, in our view, incorrect.
11|a mistake to refer to the human components of a social machineas the ‘users’ or as forming part of the ‘user base’ of the social machine
11|imply that the social machine is something separate from the human partic-ipants
11|distinction between systems that serve mainly as frameworks for thecreation of social machines and systems that actually function as social machines
11|Ushahidi
11|systems that support information collection, visualization andinteractive mapping
11|MediaWiki
11|Ushahidiand MediaWiki should be seen as frameworks that support the creation of speciﬁcsystems, such as Wikipedia and the Haitian implementation of Ushahidi.
11|Diaspora
11|such frameworks should be distinguished from actualinstances of social machines
12|O’Hara[31], for instance, talks about the use of Facebook to organize a birthday party.
12|Facebook is, in thiscase, merely serving as a form of technological scaffolding that supports the creationof a multiplicity of (probably) short-lived social machines
12|although the Web has been regarded as a social machine [18], perhaps it is moreappropriate to see the Web as the technological matrix that gives rise to a varietyof social machine systems
12|the possibility of a social machineemerging from the material matrix associated with some other system does not ruleout the possibility that the other system is in fact a social machine
12|may just be thatthe material elements of one social machine (i.e., its human and technological com-ponents) are simply recruited to form a social machine that is involved in a differentprocess.2

21|‘socio-technical perspective’ of social machines
21|Such a perspective is, however,only one among many alternative perspectives that could be countenanced.
21|there are a number of competing perspectives available
21|An alternative concept, for example, tends tosee social machines as socio-computational systems.
21|According to this view, socialmachines are socially-extended computational systems in which some aspects of thecomputational process are delegated to multiple human individuals.

23|In our view, theterm ‘social machine’ is best reserved for a class of systems whose most importantdistinguishing feature is the manner in which system-level processes are realized.

23|the results of these studies couldserve as the basis for ontology development efforts
23|Such ontologies could then beused to provide machine-readable characterizations of speciﬁc social machine in-stances.
23|our work to date has focused on the empirical-to-deductive and deductive-to-empirical stages. The aim of the third stage – taxonomyapplication – is to use the taxonomic framework to identify and characterize addi-tional instances of social machines.
23|By situating these instances within the socialmachine morphospace, we will be able to chart the location of unexplored or under-explored regions of the design space.
24|the task of taxonomy application is likely to besomething of a laborious undertaking
24|one strategy for dealing with these sorts of tasks is todraw on the (socially-situated) processing resources made available by the techno-logical infrastructure of the World Wide Web.
24|An interesting possibility, therefore, is to engineer a social machine to expedite theprocess of taxonomy application.
24|build a microtask environment, including speciﬁc game elements, inwhich participants are asked to provide answers to atomic challenges that rate andcompare a pair of social machine instances according to a dimension in our frame-work.
